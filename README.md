# pc-EVM.-Py-EVM

Py-EVM is an implementation of the Ethereum protocol in Python. It contains the low level primitives for the existing Ethereum 1.0 chain as well as emerging support for the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 / Serenity spec.

Goals

Py-EVM aims to eventually become the defacto Python implementation of the Ethereum protocol, enabling a wide array of use cases for both public and private chains.

In particular Py-EVM aims to:

be a reference implementation of the Ethereum 1.0 and 2.0 implementation in one of the most widely used and understood languages, Python.

be easy to understand and modifiable

have clear and simple APIs

come with solid, friendly documentation

deliver the low level primitives to build various clients on top (including full and light clients)

be highly flexible to support both research as well as alternate use cases like private chains.
